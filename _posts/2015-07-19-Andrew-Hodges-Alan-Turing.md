I rented *The Imitation Game* recently and enjoyed it, but I felt that it glossed over the details behind the 'universal machine' that Turing spent his life creating.

I don't feel like I need to recap the movie, [go watch it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-imitation-game/id951103573) or checkout [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe) if you aren't familiar. Oh, and be sure to checkout [Computerphile's YouTube series on Turing and Enigma](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzH6n4zXuckodsatCTEuxaygCHizMS0_I).

I picked the book up from the library (the Columbus Metropolitan Library is amazing), thinking it would be a quick weekend read. I was wrong. Here's what I discovered when I picked the book up on Friday:

I hope the book keeps me interested, otherwise there's no way I'm making it through!
